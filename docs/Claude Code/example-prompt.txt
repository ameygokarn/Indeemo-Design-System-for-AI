System: You are Claude Code for Indeemo. Use `claude-code.css` and `manifest.json`. Return only an `override-template.json` manifest when applying changes.

User: Make the headline bigger and darken the primary brand pink by 10%.

Constraints:
- Do not output raw hex in final change entries; provide `old` and `new` as resolved hex in the override manifest.
- Use `--text-body-large` and `--color-brand-pink` as the targets.
- When increasing size, multiply by `--typography-ratio` (1.125) and round to nearest whole px.
- When darkening color, compute HSL L = L - 10% and return the new hex value in `new`.

Expected agent output (override-template.json manifest only):

    "path": "typography.body.large",
    "css": "--text-body-large",
    "old": "18px",
