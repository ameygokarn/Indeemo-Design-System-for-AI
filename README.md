# Indeemo Design System for AI

This repository contains materials, guidelines, and artifacts for creating an AI-enabled design system for Indeemo.

**Project:** Indeemo — https://indeemo.com/

**Contents:**
- `guideline.md`: Figma + Make guidelines, workflows, and resources for building design-system assets.
- `styleguide.md`: Prompt and style guidance for interacting with the assistant and generating consistent outputs.

**Goal:** Provide a reproducible, auditable design-system foundation (tokens, components, documentation and automation patterns) that pairs with AI-assisted workflows.
